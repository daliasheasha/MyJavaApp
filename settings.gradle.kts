The given file appears to be a Gradle build file. To migrate the app to Java 11, you need to update the Java version in the build file.

Here is the updated content for the build file:

```
rootProject.name = "MyJavaApp"
sourceCompatibility = 11
targetCompatibility = 11
```

Please replace the existing content in your build file with the updated content above.

If you have any other files or configurations that need to be modified for the migration, please provide them, and I will assist you further.
